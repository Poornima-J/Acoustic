## Description
Who doesn't love listening to some music ? Have you ever thought how nice it would be, if we can visulaise the music we love to hear ?. It would be a visual treat for our eyes and a blessing for our ears.
If you feel so, then test our project and make learning a fun experience.

This project is a audio visualising web application in which a potential user can create a user account by entering a valid username, password, email id through the Register option 
or if the user already has an account then he/she can sign up with the credentials.After you login,in the home page you will be greated with a warm welcome note that briefly explains how to use the web app.
You can preview the details that you gave at the time of acoount creation in the My Profile Page. 

The prime function of this web app,that is to create a visualization of audio is being implemented in convertor page. Here there is an option to upload an audio in mp3 format and with the convert option
and get it converted to a video file which has a really pretty background.The user also has an option to download the generated video too. 
The user also can log out of their account using logout option.If they had checked the remember me option,then the next time they open the website, they will be automatically signed in.

## How it Works
1. Once you run the project, the first thing that you will see on your web browser is a Sign in Page, which has 2 options.  
    a. If you are a new user,that is you don't have an account in this web app then you can create a new one by clicking on Register option and filling out username, email and a password.  
    b. If you already have an account then, just use your login credentials and if you select Remember me option then the next time you login, you can automatically sign in.  
2. Next comes the home page , where you are welcomed by a welcome note which details on what does this web app really do and on which page is this functionality executed.  
3. There a My profile page which lists the details that you gave while creating an account
4. Then comes Convertor page which has the browse option to upload an audio file in mp3 format and the convert option enables you to convert the audio that you just entered into a video which contains a pretty good visualisation of audio. 
5. While the convertion process is going on you can see the visualisation of the audio as an pop up screen 
6. After the conversion process is compleated you are redirected to download page where there is a download option through which you can download the final video
7. There is also a logout page through which you can logout of the web app.
